# Climate Data Visualization

# Overview
Climate change is a difficult situation that we all face. Communicating our situation has also been difficult. As a data scientist I find that the best way to communicate difficult situations is through data. In this paper we will use data visualization to get a better understanding of our climate situation. This notebook is hosted on Kaggle and can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/jarredpriester/data-visualization-to-communicate-our-climate

# Purpose of the Project
First, to practice using the ggplot library to improve the readability of plots in my notebooks. Second, to work on telling a story using data visualization. Third, to raise awareness through data of our climate situation.

# What Did I Learn
I learned how to  use different themes in ggplot. In this notebook I used the economist theme which is based on the magazine. I learned that when talking about our current climate situation it is best to start with temperature then explore the variables that affect temperatures. 

# Dataset Used
We will be using data from the dslabs library in R. If you have not had a chance to explore the datasets from dslabs I recommend them, it is a fun and easy way to explore small datasets.

# Files Used
historical_co2.R - R script  
historical_temps_co2.Rmd - R markdown  
historical_temps_co2.pdf - PDF of notebook
