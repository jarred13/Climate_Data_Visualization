# Climate_Data_Visualization

Climate change is an issue that we all face. It will be important to continue to communicate our progress in reducing global tempetures. This project uses R to create data vizualization of global tempertures, greenhouse gases, and carbon emissions.

The dataset used is from the dslabs libary in R. This libary was created by my Harvard professor for our class.

This project consist of:
* a Kaggle notebook
* a R script
* R Markdown 
* PDF
